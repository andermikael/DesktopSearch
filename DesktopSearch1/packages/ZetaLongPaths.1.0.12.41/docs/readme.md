# Zeta Long Paths

A .NET library to access files and directories with more than 260 characters length.

## Introduction

This is a library that provides several classes and functions to perform basic operations on file paths and folder paths that are longer than the `MAX_PATH` limit of 260 characters.

If you want to use the additional convenience functions of this library with normal non-long paths, and in both .NET Core and Full, please see my new .NET Standard package [Zeta Short Paths](https://github.com/UweKeim/ZetaShortPaths).

## Quick usage

- **[NuGet .NET 4.5.2 package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZetaLongPaths)**
